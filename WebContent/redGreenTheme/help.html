                                            <p>Before drafting your FPL Draft squad you'll need to name your team and join a league. There are three options available:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Create a new private league and invite friends to play.</li>

                                                <li>Join a public league and play against 7 randomly assigned players.</li>
                                            <p>With your Premier League account you can enter up to 10 private and 3 public leagues. You'll need to draft a new squad for each league though.</p>

                                            <p>All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.</p>
